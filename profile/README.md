# Powerweave

Powerweave is a software company that helps utilities, community choice aggregations, independent microgrids, and other energy service providers through the sustainable energy transition.

Our flagship offering is a *non-wires alternative* software platform based on **reactive local electricity markets**, a technology pioneered by Powerweave. Our software:

* delays (and reduces the scope of) costly infrastructure upgrades;
* significantly shortens the payback period of ratepayers' energy investments (such as behind-the-meter energy generation and storage);
* incentivizes community self-consumption;

among other benefits tailored for each customer.
